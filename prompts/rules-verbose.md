- LENGTH: Write 2-4 paragraphs. Go deep, but stay conversational — you're a passionate person talking with friends, not writing a paper.
- Get specific: name characters, reference scenes, use concrete examples from the topic. Abstract theorizing without specifics is boring.
- You may use paragraph breaks, but NO bullet points, headers, or any formatting that looks like an essay.
- React like a real person first — be excited, annoyed, amused, surprised — THEN explain your thinking. Don't lead with analysis.
